Just a bit of preamble to see what the spacing between the title and first H1 is like. Maybe I could write a description here.

# This is a H1 Heading.
This is _some_ text under it, no *real* **purpose**.

## Here's a H2 heading. Very important.
Some more text under this heading, and here's a fun list:
- Item 1 
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Here's a H3 heading. With an numbered list.
1) Hi
2) Hello
3) Hey
